nightclaw-ops.py — Deterministic operations toolkit for NightClaw.
Replaces LLM reasoning with code for all structured checks.

Usage: python3 scripts/nightclaw-ops.py <command>  [options]
Run from workspace root.

Commands:
  integrity-check     T0/T1: SHA256 verification against manifest
  next-run-id         STARTUP.3: Compute next RUN-YYYYMMDD-NNN
  dispatch            T1: Select highest-priority dispatchable project
  scan-notifications  T1.5: Find actionable notification entries
  timing-check        T0-manager: Check if worker session is too recent
  crash-detect        T0-manager: Cross-ref SESSION-REGISTRY vs AUDIT-LOG
  transition-expiry   T2-manager: Check TRANSITION-HOLD expiry dates
  change-detect       T3-manager: Compare worker passes vs manager reviews
  audit-spine         T8: Validate T0→T4→T9 sequence per session
  audit-anomalies     T8: Scan AUDIT-LOG for anomaly patterns
  prune-candidates    T8.3: Identify NOTIFICATIONS entries eligible for pruning
  os-file-sizes       T8: Report OS compounding file line counts against bloat thresholds
  scr-verify          T8: R6 self-consistency rules (SCR-01 through SCR-08)
  dispatch-validate   Field contract validation (R2 enums, NOT EMPTY, FK)
  longrunner-extract  T2: Extract machine-parseable fields from LONGRUNNER
  idle-triage         T1.5: Determine first actionable idle cycle tier
  strategic-context   T3.5-manager: Pre-digest strategic context for idle manager
  t7-dedup            T7: Check if a signal is already documented in target file
  crash-context       T0: Retrieve context from a crashed session for recovery
  append              Append a single line to an APPEND-ONLY file (safe exec-based alternative to Edit tool)
  append-batch        Append multiple lines to an APPEND-ONLY file in one call (||| delimited)
  bundle-exec         Generic R5 transition executor (reads BUNDLE spec, resolves, validates, writes)
  validate-bundles    Parse all R5 bundles and verify syntax, ARG consistency, PROTECTED paths
  schema-render       Render Tier A YAML schema to REGISTRY.generated.md (parallel target, not canonical)
  schema-sync         Replace REGISTRY.md rendered-section bodies with generated content (idempotent)
  schema-lint         Load Tier A schema and verify REGISTRY.generated.md is byte-identical to a fresh render

Merge-2 gate-exposing commands (internal / gate-facing):
  validate-field      T6: Field-contract validation against Tier A schema (R2 enums, NOT EMPTY, FK)
  cascade-read        T6: Resolve a field value through REGISTRY cascade rules
  registry-route      T6: Return the R3 routing row for a given file path
  lock-acquire        T0: Acquire LOCK.md (status=locked, all 6 fields) — usage: lock-acquire <holder> <run_id> <expires_at_iso8601z>
  lock-release        T9: Release LOCK.md (status=released, all 6 fields reset)
  longrunner-render   T6: Render LONGRUNNER.md from phase/task data
  phase-validate      T6: Validate a phase transition against schema rules
  bootstrap           T0: LLM bootstrap projection — emit onboarding context for new LLM sessions

All output is machine-parseable. LLM reads output and acts on it.
LLM never does the computation itself.
