# HEARTBEAT.md
<!-- Injected on every heartbeat run. Keep lean. -->
<!-- Cron passes (worker/manager) run in dedicated sessions via Cowork scheduled tasks. -->
<!-- This file handles ONLY lightweight heartbeat checks — never full cron passes. -->

<!--
This is NightClaw's HEARTBEAT.md. It is
intentionally the minimum-viable heartbeat: a few quick reads, one consolidation
trigger, and an exit.

The actual operational loop is the two Cowork scheduled tasks set up in
DEPLOY-CLAUDE.md. Those are authoritative. The heartbeat is a
passive safety net that can be scoped down further — or disabled entirely —
without affecting NightClaw's correctness. See DEPLOY.md § Heartbeat
Configuration for cost-control guidance, and OPS-FAILURE-MODES entry
`heartbeat-token-drain` for the disable command if you want to turn it off.

## Heartbeat Checks (lightweight — no heavy searches)

1. **NOTIFICATIONS.md** — Read it. If any entry is unresolved and unsurfaced: surface it to {OWNER}. Add `[SURFACED YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` inline. One notification per heartbeat max.

2. **ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md** — Any rows with Escalation Pending not `none` and not surfaced? Append to NOTIFICATIONS.md and surface.

3. **[knowledge-repo]/00-inbox/** — Any files? Note count to {OWNER}. Do not process inline.

4. **Cron health** — If Last Worker Pass in ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md is more than 2 hours old with active projects: note it. Check the Cowork scheduled-tasks panel.

If nothing needs attention: reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`

## Memory Consolidation
Trigger: 7+ days since last consolidation OR 5+ dated memory files since last consolidation.
If triggered: read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files → write consolidated summary to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today's file) → append consolidation marker.
Never write to MEMORY.md — that is a protected bootstrap file. All memory writes go to dated files in memory/.
