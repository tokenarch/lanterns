# SESSION-REGISTRY.md
<!-- APPEND-ONLY. One entry per cron run. Workers append at Step 9; managers append at Step 9. -->
<!-- Purpose: reconstruct exactly what any session did, cross-reference with AUDIT-LOG.md. -->
<!-- Entry written by the session itself at its own conclusion (Step 9 for workers, Step 9 for managers). -->

## v19 Entry Format (current — for run_id counting)
<!-- run_id = RUN-YYYYMMDD-NNN. Count lines starting with ## RUN- dated today to determine N. -->
<!-- Example: ## RUN-20260404-001 | 2026-04-04T... | worker -->
<!-- Old v16 format entries (## run:nightclaw-init etc.) do NOT count toward today's sequence. -->

TASK:RUN-[YYYYMMDD]-[NNN].T9 | TYPE:SESSION_CLOSE | SESSION:[worker|manager] | RESULT:SUCCESS | TOKENS:in=[n],out=[n] | PROJECTS:[slugs] | OUTCOME:[one sentence]
